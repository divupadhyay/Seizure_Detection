Preprocessing: Performed initial data cleaning and preprocessing, including noise reduction and feature scaling, to ensure the quality of the input data for the models.
Model Development:

#Deep Learning Models:

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Implemented CNNs to capture spatial hierarchies in EEG data.
AlexNet: Adapted AlexNet, a well-known deep learning architecture, for EEG signal classification.
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): Applied LSTM networks to handle temporal dependencies in the sequential EEG data.
Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM): Used BiLSTM to capture information from both past and future contexts in the EEG signal sequences.
Machine Learning Models:

Random Forest: Leveraged ensemble learning with Random Forest for classification.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Applied KNN for its simplicity and effectiveness in classification tasks.
Support Vector Classification (SVC): Utilized SVC to create decision boundaries in the feature space.
Decision Tree: Implemented Decision Tree for a straightforward and interpretable classification model.
Logistic Regression: Employed Logistic Regression for its efficiency and ease of interpretation in binary classification.
